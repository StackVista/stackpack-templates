## Troubleshooting Node Memory Pressure

1. Check the node's current memory usage and pods on the [node highlight page](/#/components/{{ componentUrnForUrl }})
2. Review running pods and their memory requests/limits in the [topology view](/#/components/{{ componentUrnForUrl }}/topology)
3. Examine recent events and changes in the [node events](/#/components/{{ componentUrnForUrl }}/events)
4. Consider scaling up the node or redistributing workloads to reduce memory pressure
